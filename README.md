This document describes the graduation project requirements for PHP Summer Training Phase 1.

### Beginners Level

Our system is designed for making posts and job announcements (similar to a LinkedIn app).

If you need more details related to any of our components, please refer to LinkedIn for reference.

### We have 3 basic tabs (Pages):

| Home | Jobs |

| My Jobs | Profile |
|---------|---------|
| - Users can see the jobs they posted and view the applications filled for these jobs. <br> - When users view an application, they will see two buttons: one for Approve and the other for Decline. <br> - When users click approve or decline, an automatic email will be sent to the applicant with a default reject or accept email. | - Users can edit their names. <br> - Users can see their posts and edit or delete any of them. |
